* Use the INSERT INTO command to insert (Create) data into a database table
* Use SELECT statements to select (Read) data from a database table
* Use the WHERE clause to select data from specific table rows
* Use comparison operators, like < or >, to select specific data
* Use UPDATE statements to update data within a database table
* Use DELETE statements to delete data from a database table

## SQL Queries
> source/s: https://learning.flatironschool.com/courses/3299/pages/sql-queries?module_item_id=143867

* Define a query as an SQL statement that retrieves data from a database
* Use the ORDER BY modifier to order tables by specific SELECT statements
* Use the ASC and DESC modifiers to sort queries in ascending or descending order
* Use the LIMIT modifier to determine the number of records to retrieve from a dataset
* Use the BETWEEN modifier to retrieve records that contain a value that is within a given range
* Use the NULL data type keyword to insert new records into a table
* Use the COUNT function to count the number of records that meet a certain condition
* Use the GROUP BY function to group your results according to the values in a given column

## Aggregate Functions
> source/s: https://learning.flatironschool.com/courses/3299/pages/aggregate-functions?module_item_id=143870

* Define aggregate functions and when to use them
* Use the following aggregate functions in SQL queries: average, sum, count, minimum, maximum

## Questions

Q: Match each tool for interacting with a SQLite database with the descriptions below.

Tools:

1) `sqlite` command line interface tool
2) VSCode SQLite extension
3) DB Browser for SQLite application

Options:

a) Easy to run quick commands but no graphical representation of the data
b) Easy to access and easy to see a graphical representation of the data, but can't run SQL commands
c) Can run SQL commands and can see a graphical representation of the data, but more work to access
